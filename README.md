# BootstrapDemo Bootstrap 5 Demo

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap 5 to build clean, modern, and responsive web pages. It includes three main pages: Home, About, and Contact, each composed by remixing Bootstrap components for a unique and visually appealing layout.

## How the Project Was Built
1. **Exploration:** Reviewed Bootstrap 5 documentation and official Examples to identify high-quality UI patterns (navbar, cards, hero, forms, etc.).
2. **Component Selection:** Chose and remixed components (not full pages) to create original layouts for each page.
3. **Page Composition:** Built `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html` using Bootstrap 5 via CDN, ensuring responsiveness and modern design.
4. **Styling:** Added custom CSS in `styles.css` for polish and consistency.
5. **Testing:** Verified responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
6. **Version Control & Hosting:** (To be completed by user) Push to GitHub and deploy via GitHub Pages or Netlify.
